Due to the fact that all conventional loan programmes (including Conventional, Jumbo, FHA, VA, and USDA) call for the lender to consider the applicant's taxable income from their income tax returns (personal and/or company). Due to the lender's restriction to using a small portion of the business owner's genuine income, the latter feels stuck and frustrated.</p>

                        <p className={styles.para}> Owner-occupied and second houses are exempt from prepayment penalties, thus the loan can be refinanced if needed as soon as the applicant is approved for a conventional home loan. Many of our clients use this technique to purchase their ideal home, then once they and their tax advisors deem the best moment, they choose to refinance it into a conventional loan. It enables the business owner to assume control and make their own terms for property purchase.</p>
                        <p className={styles.para}>This loan program is similar to our Bank Statement Program, but the documentation requirements are much easier than providing 12-24 months of bank statements.</p>
