The first loan we use is a regular CONVENTIONAL loan to pay the majority of the purchase price (between 75% and 80%), and the second loan we use is a Home Equity Line of Credit to cover the remaining 10% to 15%. Both loans close on the same day, and your down payment (10%) plus both loans equal 100% of the total purchase price.</p>

                    <p className={styles.para}>Jumbo financing's qualification requirements might be substantially more onerous than those for conventional lending.
                        For instance, depending on the recentness of the occurrence, you could not be eligible for a jumbo loan if you have a recent housing event like a foreclosure, bankruptcy, short sale, etc. in your background. We employ Conventional underwriting standards for our COMBO loan, which are laxer than Jumbo standards. Before submitting an application for a COMBO loan, be sure to review our Waiting Period Chart for Conventional Financing if you just experienced a housing incident.
                        Fixed rates and a lower down payment requirement. The minimum down payment for jumbo loans is frequently more than 10%. Additionally, the interest rate is often only fixed for 5â€“10 years with most Jumbo financing schemes. The majority of the financing for a COMBO is fixed for 30 years.
