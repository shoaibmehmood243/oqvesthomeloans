The reason is because banks are required to calculate your income based on the taxable income reported on the tax returns of the business owner. Business owners have access to a set of guidelines that act as a tax defence strategy thanks to the US tax code. A whole sector of the tax profession is devoted to reducing business owners' tax obligations. When a business owner uses an aggressive tax strategy, their life is wonderfulâ€”until they go to apply for a mortgage, that is!</p>

                <p className="text-center">This issue is resolved by our bank statement loan programme. We give the business owner the option of using the regular business deposit income in their bank statements as the income on the new loan instead of tax returns. It frequently paints a more accurate picture of the applicant's actual income profile and business profitability, according to our research.</p>

            <div className={styles.bank}>
                <h3 className="m-0">How does it Work? </h3>
                <p className="mt-1">The calculation process is simple and straight-forward.</p>
                <div>
                    <h6>Here's how we calculate the qualifying income on a Bank Statement Loan:</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We examine your business's bank statements from the previous 12 to 24 months, taking note of all regular business deposits.</li>
                        <li>Divide the figure ($) by the number of total bank statements being reviewed.</li>
                        <li>Multiply this figure X your ownership percentage (%) in the business.</li>
                        <li>Multiply this number X 50% (this is a default business expense ratio that is applied to the income)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h6>And the resultant figure becomes the monthly income for your new loan.</h6>

            <h1>So you might be asking, <strong>"What happens if my business is operating with expense ratio lower than 50%?"</strong></h1>
            <div className="m-auto mt-5 w-full md:w-11 lg:w-10">
                <p>Great inquiry. With an expense ratio much below 50%, many businesses are able to operate. If that's the case, just present a letter from a certified tax advisor stating your company's precise expense ratio. For instance, if your company operates at a 30% ratio, you would multiply the number in step 4 above by 70%. If it's 25%, multiply that number by 75%, and so on.</p>
                <p>Owner-occupied and second houses are exempt from prepayment penalties, thus the loan can be refinanced if needed as soon as the applicant is approved for a conventional home loan. Many of our clients use this technique to purchase their ideal home, then once they and their tax advisors deem the best moment, they choose to refinance it into a conventional loan. It gives the business owner the power to decide for themselves how and when to buy a house.</p>
